Data Pipeline Project 
Tools being used: Python, Docker, MySQL

Local Caf√© contacts me for building a pipeline delivering customer order info from CSV files: 
Contains at least 100 orders of 3 types:
1) Customer Cash Transactions (25/08/2021 09:00,Chesterfield,Richard Copeland,"Regular Flavoured iced latte - Hazelnut - 2.75, Large Latte - 2.45",5.2,CARD,5494173772652516)
2) Customer Card Transaction (25/08/2021 09:08,Chesterfield,Michael Sparrow,"Regular Latte - 2.15, Large Latte - 2.45",4.6,CASH,)
3) Malformed Transactions (25/08/2021 10:11,Chesterfield,Donald Wilson,Regular Flavoured iced latte - Caramel - 2.75,2.75,CARD,9192463810678210) (no speech mark)
For all of these remove Personally Identifiable Information (Names, Card No.)

Roughly what I have to do is: Extract and Transform data from CSV files, Load them into SQL databases with the help of Docker (?)
And with that comes the Docker Containers, SQL Adminer stuff which I don't understand

App Project Instructions will take out after project is finished

CAN SWITCH BETWEEN TABLE AND REGULAR BY CLICKING ON VSCODE SYMBOL ON TOP LEFT FOR CSV FILES
